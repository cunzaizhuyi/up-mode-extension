## What
This is a browser extension that protects the author's privacy by hiding
pinned browser extensions.

This plugin is suitable for the following scenarios:

- When content creators start recording videos
- When teachers start giving lectures
- When developers conduct team technical sharing
- When employees start internal meeting screen sharing

In these scenarios, you can enable browser privacy protection with one click by hiding all pinned browser extensions.

Save half a minute with each use.

At the same time, you get a cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing interface, which also makes sharing itself more focused.
