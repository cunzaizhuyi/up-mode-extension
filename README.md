## What
This is a browser extension that protects the author's privacy by hiding
pinned browser extensions.

This plugin is suitable for the following scenarios:

- When content creators start recording videos
- When teachers start giving lectures
- When developers conduct team technical sharing
- When employees start internal meeting screen sharing

In these scenarios, you can enable browser privacy protection with one click by hiding all pinned browser extensions.

At the same time, you get a cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing interface, which also makes sharing itself more focused.
